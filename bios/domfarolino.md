## Co-op Work Experience

### Mozilla Software Engineering Intern
Over the summer of 2017 I was a software engineering intern on the graphics team of Firefox
at Mozilla. I helped implement and test Off-Main-Thread-Painting to speed up the time it takes
Firefox to render a page. The result was faster paints as well as giving the ability to let the
JavaScript engine perform the same amount of work in less time (due to the faster paints).

During this co-op I learned a lot about C/C++, web browser internals, web standards & their
implementations, and low level security. I worked mainly in C++ and a little bit in Python. I
got a deeper understanding of the GCC compiler tools as well

### Interactive Intelligence Software Testing Intern

My first two co-op rotations were for a company called Interactive Intelligence in Indianapolis
which made contact center software for companies such as Nest, Intuit, Hilton, Walmart, etc. I
was in charge of creating testing framework in Java and built an internal web application in Node.js
to help about 80 platform test engineers triage test failures from multiple sources.

## Project Sought
I'm interested in a project that satisfies one more of the following:

 - Low level security and/or operating systems
 - Web standards implementations & JavaScript/browser technologies
 - Number theory
 - Graph theory
