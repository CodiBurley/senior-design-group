# Notes

This is a collection of notes I've taken throughout my experience with the senior design
project on a MacBook Pro. Following http://blog.japaric.io/quickstart/ and
https://docs.rs/cortex-m-quickstart/0.2.0/cortex_m_quickstart/.

# Dependencies

### Installing `xargo`

Ran `cargo install xargo`

### Installing `OpenOCD`

Ran `brew install openocd`

### Installing GCC ARM toolchain

Ran `brew install caskroom/cask/gcc-arm-embedded` which I got from
https://gist.github.com/joegoggins/7763637#gistcomment-1250738. This yielded the following:

# Running

```sh
xargo build --example hello
```

This yielded an error, which was solvable by:

```sh
rustup component add rust-src
```

Which got me one step further...I'm now seeing

```
error: linking with `arm-none-eabi-gcc` failed: exit code: 1
```
