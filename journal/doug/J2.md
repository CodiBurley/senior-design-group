The openocd files and memory.x file is in the tar ball titled J2.tar.gz

For the most part I followed the quick start guide under the doc.rs site and fell back to the blog when confused.

This was what I used for the memory in order to get it to work correctly.

````
MEMORY
{
  /* NOTE K = KiBi = 1024 bytes */
  /* TODO Adjust these memory regions to match your device memory layout */
  FLASH : ORIGIN = 0x00000000, LENGTH = 256K
  RAM : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 16K
}

/* This is where the call stack will be allocated. */
/* The stack is of the full descending type. */
/* You may want to use this variable to locate the call stack and static
   variables in different memory regions. Below is shown the default value */
/* _stack_start = ORIGIN(RAM) + LENGTH(RAM); */

/* You can use this symbol to customize the location of the .text section */
/* If omitted the .text section will be placed right after the .vector_table
   section */
/* This is required only on microcontrollers that store some configuration right
   after the vector table */
/* _stext = ORIGIN(FLASH) + 0x400; */
````



When I initially installed openocd via apt I got version 9.0 which I determined to be broken.

I updated to openocd version 10.0-dev by cloning source and building by doing a ./configure, make, sudo make install

https://sourceforge.net/p/openocd/code/ci/master/tree/

The configuration files I needed were located at /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts

Those files can also be found in the J2.tar.gz file.

Before attempting to write the application to the device I followed the instructions found here and installed the s130 which I included in git along with the device specific information.

All Device Support

Essentially  what this means is that they provide a HAL or a hardware abstraction layer that gives interfaces to the gpio buttons etc/ when going through the rust2svd and piping it through rustfmt add the following line to a file in the project directory as rustfmt.toml

```
max_width = 400
```
