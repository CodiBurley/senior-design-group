##Hardware

nRF51-DK (nRF51 Development Kit) was purchased from Nordic Semiconductors.

### nRF51-DK

* Low cost (roughly $31)
* Integrated JTAG Debugger
* SAM4l (Arm Cortex M0)

[product page](https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/nRF51-DK)

*****

## First glance

### Debuggers

Two JTag softwares appear to work with the integrated debugger

* openocd
  * (linux) sudo apt-get install openocd
  * (mac) brew install open-ocd
* JLinkExe <--- This is the one we want
  * (windows) [download](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink)
  * Linux/Mac [download](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack)

## Time

[13:40] Using tocks page for reference [get started](https://github.com/helena-project/tock/blob/master/doc/Getting_Started.md). Going to attempt to get tock running on the device.

[13:45] Plugged in the device and linux immediately loaded the drivers. Apparently it contains some flash storage.

[13:47] Contains four files, three of which are links are redirects to other webpages with product information. One is a readme.txt which includes the following. Placing files in tar ball in journal named J1.tar.gz.

```
SEGGER J-Link MSD volume.
This volume is used to update the flash content of your target device.
```

[13:51] Updating rust to nightly-2017-11-18

```
rustup install nightly-2017-11-18
```

[13:55] Installing xargo with:

```
cargo install xargo
```

[13:57] Installing `arm-none-eabi` toolchain on ubuntu. Ran the command and saw the below. installed anyways.

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:team-gcc-arm-embedded/ppa
[sudo] password for douglas: 
 This PPA is an alternative to toolchain released at https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded. The source codes for both are same. Currently supports Ubuntu 10.04/12.04/14.04/14.10 32 and 64 bit.

Detailed explanations to Launchpad PPA can be found at https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/. That website explains how a PPA is set up and how to add existing PPA and install software from it.

Here are quick steps to install toolchain from this PPA on Ubuntu before 14.04:

Step1: Inside Ubuntu, open a terminal and input
       "sudo add-apt-repository ppa:team-gcc-arm-embedded/ppa"

Step2: Continue to input
       "sudo apt-get update"

Step3: Continue to input to install toolchain
       "sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-embedded"

To remove installed toolchain, just input "sudo apt-get remove gnu-arm-embedded".
To update the toolchain, just repeat above step2 and step3.

If it reports error message of conflict to gcc-arm-none-eabi, which is likely if upgrading from 4.x to 5+, please uninstall it first with:
       "sudo apt-get remove gcc-arm-none-eabi"

Questions should be asked at https://answers.launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded

Bug can be filed at https://bugs.launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+filebug. It is highly encouraged to ask question first before filing a bug.
 More info: https://launchpad.net/~team-gcc-arm-embedded/+archive/ubuntu/ppa
Press [ENTER] to continue or ctrl-c to cancel adding it

```

Ran sudo apt update

```
sudo apt update
```

Installed gcc-arm-embeedded

```
sudo apt install gcc-arm-embedded
```

[14:09] git clone https://github.com/helena-project/tock.git ... Cafe internet is slow

[14:21] Building project for the nRF51-DK for tock ... its doing a ton of git pulls.. this may have been a mistake to do this at a coffee shop

[14:41]  ran make flash

```
> $ make flash                                                                    [±master ✓]

```

possibly need JLinkExe? I thought this was for windows but maybe I'm wrong

[14:45] Reviewing the getting started page, installed the tockloader platform.

[14:49] Documentation keeps sending me in circle of links.

[14:53] I stand corrected they have the software for Mac and Linux as well. [JLinkExe](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack) ... Network is getting crowded.. it went from me to 14 highschool girls using instagram and writing papers for psychology.. I don't know if I can survive

[14:57] Some Nordic looking guy showed up and is meeting up with one of the girls. Guy could pass for a worse looking chris hemsworth with brunette hair instead of blond. I have a minute left on my deb download.. 

[14:59] Huzaah. When you install it a bash command called jlink appears but it appears a alias is setup for JLinkExe

```
$ sudo dpkg -i JLink_Linux_V622d_x86_64.deb 
```

[15:00] rip me

```

[15:02] Unplugged it and plugged it into a different USB port. Ran again and I think it worked. It may have been because I had a folder open from earlier.

[15:06] Attempting to install the blink example for the userland app

```

[15:08] Hmmm. Nothing is happening.. Maybe not the right blinky led? I mean led5 is kinda flashing but that fer was on before I tried to flash. Time to dive into the code.

[15:09] The code 'asks' the kernel how many leds are on the board and then flashes all of them? Well that doesn't seem to be working. Could be the leds aren't registered?

[15:11] Tock loader is a peice of magikarp Used make instead and it worked. Its currently flashing the four leds on the board in a neat pattern.

[15:14] Going to try to get the live debugger up with gdb

[15:17] Well that was easy. 

created a .gdbinit file with the following

```
target remote localhost:2331
load
mon reset
break reset_handler
```

In the same folder ran the following command

```
JLinkGDBServer -device nrf51422 -speed 1200 -if swd -AutoConnect 1 -port 2331
```

In a separate terminal but same folder ran

```
arm-none-eabi-gdb -x .gdbinit boards/nrf51dk/target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/nrf51dk
```

and  I was able to step through the assembly on the device. Documentation checkout this [readme](https://github.com/helena-project/tock/blob/master/boards/nrf51dk/README.md)
