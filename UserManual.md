# User Manual

> Warning: Practical usage and functionality is limited

This document is meant to guide the user when using the OSxide RTOS. Seeing as how
the project is primarily exploratory for the team members involved, the practical usage
and overall functionality of the operating system is extremely limited, due to the complexity
of the project. Consequently, the user guide this document describes is extremely *bare-bones*
and largely aimed at a technical audience.
